```bash
git clone git@github.com:jhordyess/employees-api-node.git
```

```bash
code employees-api-node
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root folder by copying the example from the `.env.example` file. And replace the values with your own.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

4. Open the command palette and select the option `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

5. Wait for the container to be built and the project to be started.

6. Open the terminal in VSCode and run the project:

```bash

```

7. Now your can test the endpoints at <http://localhost:3000/api/v1>. The API docs(Swagger UI) will be available at <http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs>

## How to use for production with Docker

To run the project in production with Docker, remember to create the `.env` file and replace the values with your own.

Then, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

To stop or remove, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
